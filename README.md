# Database-Design
Files related to my first foray into database design as a part of my Masters of Data Science program at Pitt

In this project, over the course of the semester I worked through the design process of a database using [the Detailed NFL Play-by-Play dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015)

In order to make the project easier to manage, I did not use the complete dataset. After reducing the sample size to the top 100 rows, I selected only the most relevant columns to include as entities and attributes.

In this repository, you will find examples of the SQL I composed to structure, restructure, and populate the tables for this data as well as some sample queries.
